# E-Commerce_salesanalysis
This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce sales data to understand overall performance and profitability. I built an interactive Power BI dashboard showing key KPIs like total sales, profit, quantity, and average order value.

I analyzed profit trends month-wise and observed that certain months were loss-making, which could indicate higher discounts or operational costs. Category-wise analysis showed Clothing contributing the highest sales volume, while sub-category analysis revealed Printers as the most profitable segment.

I also performed regional and customer analysis to identify top states and high-value customers, and analyzed payment modes where COD was the most preferred option. Overall, the dashboard helps stakeholders quickly identify growth opportunities and problem areas.
